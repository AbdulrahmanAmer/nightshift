# Change requests to frozen contracts

Format per entry:

## CR-<n>: <short title>
- **From:** WP-<letter> / task
- **Change:** what to add or alter (exact names, types)
- **Why:** the concrete need
- **Status:** open | applied in <commit> | rejected (<reason>)

(none yet)

## CR-C4-1: fastapi (and httpx test client) in the `dev` extra
- **From:** C4 ns_tts / Task 4
- **Change:** add `"fastapi>=0.115"` to `[project.optional-dependencies].dev` in `pyproject.toml`. `numpy` is already a core dependency, so no change for it. After it lands, delete the `# pyright: reportMissingImports=false` line in `ns_tts/server.py` and the `pytest.importorskip("fastapi")` in `tests/test_tts_server.py`.
- **Why:** CI installs only `.[dev]`; without fastapi the server tests are skipped and pyright cannot resolve the imports. `uvicorn` is not needed in CI (only `ns_tts.server.main` imports it, lazily).
- **Status:** open

## CR-C4-2: `TtsCfg.engine` must accept `"qwentts"`
- **From:** C4 ns_tts / Task 3
- **Change:** in `ns_common/models.py` change `TtsCfg.engine` to `Literal["qwentts", "reference"]` with default `"qwentts"` (spec 15.4 `/health` engine names; the old `"faster"` engine was dropped). `select_engine` already treats a legacy `"faster"` value as qwentts, so the change is backward compatible. `Runtime.default("cpu-dev")` keeps `engine="reference"`. Also update the tests that assert the default.
- **Why:** with the current Literal a config cannot name the default engine, so `ns verify` cannot write `qwentts`/`reference` choices symmetrically (NS-W301 fallback writes `reference`; the happy path writes nothing).
- **Status:** applied on main (engine literal qwentts|reference|faster, default qwentts; NS-E310/E311 added)

## CR-C4-3: allow `subprocess` in `ns_tts/engine.py` once TID251 is enabled
- **From:** C4 ns_tts / Task 3
- **Change:** when `ruff` gets `TID251` banning `subprocess` (ENGINEERING.md section 8), add `ns_tts/engine.py` to the per-file-ignores list and to the hygiene-test allow-list, next to `ns_common/ffmpeg.py`.
- **Why:** `QwenttsEngine` runs the `qwentts.exe` CLI with `subprocess.run` (list args, never `shell=True`, with a timeout), as spec 6.1 describes.
- **Status:** open

## CR-C4-4: TTS-specific error codes
- **From:** C4 ns_tts / Task 3
- **Change:** add to `contracts/errors.json`: `NS-E31x` "The TTS engine failed (qwentts exited, timed out, or produced no audio)" and "A stored voice embedding is missing or was made by another engine". Until then `ns_tts` raises `NS-E202` (engine process/model failure) and `NS-E301` (bad voice data), whose messages do not fit well.
- **Why:** error messages shown to the operator should name TTS, not the language model.
- **Status:** applied on main (engine literal qwentts|reference|faster, default qwentts; NS-E310/E311 added)

## CR-C4-5: optional `cliff_lines` on `TtsItem`
- **From:** C4 ns_tts / Task 4
- **Change:** add `cliff_lines: tuple[str, ...] = ()` to `ns_common.tts_client.TtsItem` and send it as `cliff_lines` in `TtsClient.speak_batch` / `speak` bodies (the server already accepts the additive field). C6's voice stage fills it from `story.json`.
- **Why:** spec 7.5 wants 1,200 ms before a cliff line; the spec 15.4 request has no field to carry which lines are cliffs.
- **Status:** open
